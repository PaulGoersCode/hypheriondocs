This SERVER SIDE ONLY mod is a simple-to-use Minecraft to Discord/Discord to Minecraft chat-bot with Whitelisting features. It allows you to bridge the gap between your discord and minecraft server.
&nbsp;

![](../img/Features.png)

This mod allows you to:

* Relay your Minecraft server chat to Discord
* Relay your Discord chat (in a pre-configured channel) to Minecraft
* Let players whitelist/unwhitelist themselves directly from Discord (Admins and persons with KICK perms can unwhitelist anyone)
* View active players on the server inside of discord
* And, much more to come
